#Variables using lowercase letters for the first word in variable names, and an uppercase letter after the first word.
firstNAME = "Loc" # This is a string variable that is referred the piece of text
year = 2022 # This is int variable that converts a string of digits to an integer value
moneyInPocket = 0.75 # This is float variable that converts as tring of digits to a floating-point 
#Constant uses all uppercase letter for the names of variables that contain values that program never changes
LASTNAME = "Nguyen" # This is a string constant that is referred the piece of text
CLASS_START = 11 # This is int constant that converts a string ofdigits to an integer value
ZERO = 0 # This is float constant that converts as tring of digits to a floating-point
# Demonstrates the use of variables, constants and operaters
print(firstNAME + " " + LASTNAME) # This is string concatenation operator uses for gather two or more strings to form a new string
print(-year) # This is negation that  be used only in the unary form.
print(year**moneyInPocket) # This is exponentation that is the operation of multiplying a number (b) a certain number of times (n) by itself
print(CLASS_START * year) # This is multiplication that  be the asterisk character to multiply number
print(CLASS_START / year) # This is division the number on its left by the number on its right and returns a floating point value
print(year // CLASS_START) # This is quotient performs integer division and returns a truncated integer result
print(year % CLASS_START) # This is remainder  returns the remainder after division
print(CLASS_START + year) # This is addition used for addition and return sum will return the value
print(CLASS_START - year) # This is subtraction takes two operands, the first operand on the left and the second operand on the right, and returns the difference of the second operand from the first operand.
