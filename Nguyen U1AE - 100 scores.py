#Variables using lowercase letters for the first word in variable names, and an uppercase letter after the first word.
firstNAME = "Loc" # This is a string variable that is referred the piece of text
year = 2022 # This is int variable that converts a string of digits to an integer value
moneyInPocket = 0.75 # This is float variable that converts as tring of digits to a floating-point 

#Constant uses all uppercase letter for the names of variables that contain values that program never changes
LASTNAME = "Nguyen" # This is a string constant that is referred the piece of text
CLASS_START = 11 # This is int constant that converts a string of digits to an integer value
ZERO = 0 # This is float constant that converts as tring of digits to a floating-point

# Demonstrates the use of variables, constants and operaters
print(firstNAME + " " + LASTNAME) # This is string concatenation operator uses for gather two or more strings to form a new string
print(-year) # This is negation 
print(year**moneyInPocket) # This is exponentation 
print(CLASS_START * year) # This is multiplication 
print(CLASS_START / year) # This is division
print(year // CLASS_START) # This is quotient 
print(year % CLASS_START) # This is remainder
print(CLASS_START + year) # This is addition
print(CLASS_START - year) # This is subtraction
